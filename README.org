There is a special Docker image for developing on Java for Palm OS (v5).

Image based on:
- Java 1.5
- Sun Java Wireless Toolkit (WTK) 2.5.2-01

* How to use
** Manually install some files
Some files should be added to cloned repository by hand:
- JDK 1.5 for Linux (i586). Filename should be:
  =jdk-1_5_0_22-linux-i586.bin=. This file should be copied to the root of
  git-repository. MD5SUM should be: =df5dae6d50d2abeafb472dde6d9a17f3=.
- Sun Java Wireless Toolkit. Filename:
  =sun_java_wireless_toolkit-2.5.2_01-linuxi486.bin=. It should be compiled to
  the root of repository. MD5SUM should be:
  =6b70b6e6d426eac121db8a087991589f=. If md5sum differs — then byte-patching of
  install package will fail! This action necessary to automatically accept
  license and install files without any input from user.
- =jartoprc= files should be extracted from [[https://palmdb.net/app/jvm][this archive]] and copied into
  =jar2prc/= catalog. Expected result:
  #+begin_src
  jar2prc/
  ├── bin
  └── lib
      └── jclFoundation10
  #+end_src
** Build docker image
#+begin_src
  docker compose build
#+end_src
** Start container
#+begin_src
  ./run-dev-env.sh
#+end_src
** Stop container
#+begin_src
  ./stop-dev-env.sh
#+end_src

* Special mounted catalogs
Some catalogs will be mounted from root directory in cloned git-repository to
=/home/devel/= catalog inside docker container.
- j2mewtk :: WTK projects will be stored in this catalog
- jar2prc :: =jartoprc= Windows application
- sdcard :: SD-card attached to Palm emulator will be mounted here
- sources :: Catalog for different sources
- workspace :: Eclipse settings and project

* Which programs installed to docker container
- [[https://github.com/uARM-Palm/uARM][uARM]] :: Palm (v5) emulator from Dmitry Grindberg. There is alias =emulator= to
  run uARM with Palm Tungsten E2 image (downloaded and installed when image
  was built).
- ktoolbar :: project builder for WTK. JAR files should be built here.
- jar2prc :: Windows program to convert JAR to PRC (program file format for
  Palm). Running via wine32.
- Eclipse Pulsar :: IDE for J2ME development ([[https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/helios/sr1/pulsar-mobile-developers][link]])

* Where to find JVM for Palm?
There are =PRC= files in [[https://palmdb.net/app/jvm][this archive]]. Files' description can be found also in
this archive.
